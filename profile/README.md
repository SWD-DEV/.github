Yes, we are building GitHub on GitHub. We are proud  to be part of the work of millions of developers, companies and robots across the solar system 🪐. Yes, [Robots](https://#)!

### 🍿 An interconnected community

The open source community is the 💗 heart of GitHub and fundamental to how we build software today. See for yourself:

- [GitHub Sponsors](https://#) helped support more than **5k** individuals and projects around the world 🌍
- Open source projects on GitHub received a stunning **218 million** contributions 🚀 in the last year alone
- **Every minute** a developer creates a new release 🏄 for a public project on GitHub

Now that we are talking about the important things ☝️, are you contributing to open source? Yes? Okay, you rock! 🎸 If not, we can help you get started! Open source software is made by people just like you. Learn more about [how to contribute](https://#).

### 🦦 Contributing to the ecosystem

We contribute to the tools 🔧 we rely on to build and run GitHub, while also maintaining 🧙‍♂️ our own open source projects like:

- [Personax CLI](https://#) - A command line tool for Personax
- [Large File Storage](https://#) - A local git extension for versioning large file
